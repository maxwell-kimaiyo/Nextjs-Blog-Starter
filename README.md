# Nextjs Blog Starter


## About

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.

This is a starter project that provides an example of how to use Next.js to build a blog for bloggers.

This project exists to make it easier to get started a creating production app in React. You are invited to use it as a reference or to copy it and use it as a base for your own projects. Contributions to improve this project are welcome.
